= Annex F  Rtree Spatial Index Extension (Normative)

*F.1  Extension Title*  

::
Rtree Spatial Indexes

*F.2  Introduction*  

::
The rtree index extension provides a means to encode an rtree index for geometry values in a GeoPackage. An RTree index provides a significant performance advantage for searches with basic envelope spatial criteria that return subsets of the rows in a feature table with a non-trivial number (thousands or more) of rows.

*F.3  Extension Author*  

::
GeoPackage SWG, author_name “gpkg”.

*F. 4  Extension Name or Template*  

::
“gpkg_rtree_index”

*F.5  Extension Type*  

::
*New* Requirement dependent on clauses link:#_bookmark29[2.1.3] and link:#_bookmark99[3.1.2].

*F.6  Applicability*  

::
This extension applies to any column specified in the gpkg_geometry_columns table.

*F.7  Scope*  

::
Write-only, because it does not change the result of reads, although it may improve their performance.


*F.8  Requirements*

::
This extension uses the rtree implementation provided by the SQLite R*Tree Module extension documented at http://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html[http://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html].

*F.8.1  GeoPackage*  

::
The tables below contain SQL templates with variables. Replace the following template variables with the specified values to create the required SQL statements:
::
<t>: The name of the feature table containing the geometry column + 
<c>: The name of the geometry column in <t> that is being indexed  +
<i>: The name of the integer primary key column in <t> as specified in link:#_bookmark40[Req 29]

*F8.1.1  Create Virtual Table*  

::
Rtree spatial indexes on geometry columns SHALL be created using the SQLite Virtual Table RTree extension. An application that creates a spatial index SHALL create it using the following SQL statement template:

|====
|CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE rtree_<t>_<c>
|====

::
where <t> and <c> are replaced with the names of the feature table and geometry column being indexed. The rtree function id parameter becomes the virtual table 64-bit signed integer primary key id column, and the min/max x/y parameters are min- and max-value pairs (stored as 32-bit floating point numbers) for each dimension that become the virtual table data columns that are populated to create the spatial rtree index.

*F.8.1.2  Load Spatial Index Values*

::
The indexes provided by the SQLite Virtual Table RTree extension are not automatic indices. This means the index data structure needs to be manually populated, updated and queried.

Each newly created spatial index SHALL be populated using the following SQL statement

|====
|INSERT OR REPLACE INTO rtree_<t>_<c>  
SELECT <i>, st_minx(<c>), st_maxx(<c>),
|====


where <t> and <c> are replaced with the names of the feature table and geometry column being indexed and <i> is replaced with the name of the feature table integer primary key column.

*F8.1.3  Define Triggers to Maintain Spatial Index Values*

::
For each spatial index in a GeoPackage, corresponding insert, update and delete triggers that update the spatial index SHALL be present on the indexed geometry column. These spatial index triggers SHALL be defined as follows:

image:/media/Annex_F_8_1_3_1.png[image,600,300]
image:/media/Annex_F_8_1_3_2.png[image,600,900]
image:/media/Annex_F_8_1_3_3.png[image,700,350]
image:/media/Annex_F_8_1_3_4.png[image,650,200]

where <t> and <c> are replaced with the names of the feature table and geometry column being indexed and <i> is replaced with the name of the feature table integer primary key column.

*F.8.1.4  GeoPackage SQLite Configuration*

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|========================================================================
|Setting |Option | Shall / Not (Value) | Discussion
|compile | SQLITE_ENABLE_RTREE | Shall | Rtrees are used for GeoPackage Spatial Indexes
|compile | SQLITE_RTREE_INT_ONLY | Not  |  Rtrees with floating point values are used for GeoPackage Spatial Indexes
|========================================================================

*F.8.1.5  GeoPackage SQLite Extension*

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|====================================================================================
|*SQL Function* | *Description* | *Use* 
| ST_IsEmpty(geom. Geometry): INTEGER | Returns 1 if geometry value is empty, 0 if not empty, NULL if geometry value is NULL. | Test if a geometry value corresponds to the empty set
|ST_MinX(geom. Geometry) : REAL | Returns the minimum X value of the bounding Envelope of a Geometry |Update the spatial index on a geometry column in a feature table.
|ST_MaxX(geom. Geometry) : REAL | Returns the maximum X value of the bounding Envelope of a Geometry |Update the spatial index on a geometry column in a feature table.
|ST_MinY(geom. Geometry) : REAL| Returns the minimum Y value of the bounding Envelope of a Geometry | Update the spatial index on a geometry column in a feature table.
|ST_MaxY(geom. Geometry) : REAL | Returns the maximum Y value of the bounding Envelope of a Geometry | Update the spatial index on a geometry column in a feature table.
|====================================================================================

The SQL functions on geometries in this SQLite Extension SHALL operate correctly on extended geometry types specified by Annex J and/or Annex K when those extensions are also implemented.
